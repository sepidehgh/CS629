Overview:	

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), is designed to assess the general health and nutritional status of adults 
and children in the United States. The extent of this survey is very broad, covering demographic, laboratory, and examination information. 
In this project, I tried to visualize race percentage in people with diabetes and gender ratio of people with diabetes in each race from 
2017-2018 survey result. Here is the link to the data source:

Instructions: for testing the code and datasets

1.	I included the data sets I used in the “Data” folder. 
2.	Please run the python code first which prepares the data for use in R. This results in a CSV file which you can then use in R. 
For your convenience, I also included this CSV file in the “Data” folder.
3.	Next, to see the visualizations, please run the R code.
